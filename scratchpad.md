# Uber Drivers App - Compatibility Fixes

## Task: Apply Modern Flutter/Android Compatibility Fixes

Based on successful fixes applied to the user app, need to resolve compatibility issues for modern Android/Flutter tooling.

## Plan:
- [ ] Create new branch for compatibility fixes
- [ ] Check current Gradle wrapper version
- [ ] Update Android Gradle Plugin version
- [ ] Check and remove incompatible dependencies
- [ ] Update pubspec.yaml dependencies
- [ ] Test build compatibility
- [ ] Document changes
- [ ] Create unit tests
- [ ] Commit changes and create PR

## Key Fixes to Apply:
1. Update Gradle wrapper to 8.4 for Java 21 compatibility
2. Upgrade Android Gradle Plugin to 8.1.0
3. Remove incompatible plugins: flutter_geofire, restart_app, rounded_loading_button
4. Comment out Geofire functionality due to namespace compatibility issues
5. Remove unused imports and clean up code
6. Update README.md with project status

## Progress:
- [x] Create new branch for compatibility fixes
- [x] Check current Gradle wrapper version and update to 8.4
- [x] Update Android Gradle Plugin to 8.1.0 in settings.gradle
- [x] Remove incompatible dependencies from pubspec.yaml
- [x] Comment out Geofire functionality in code
- [x] Remove unused imports and clean up code
- [x] Update README.md with project status
- [ ] Create unit tests and commit changes

## Lessons:
- Modern Android tooling requires Gradle 8.4+ and AGP 8.1.0+
- Some Flutter plugins are incompatible with newer AGP versions
- Geofire has namespace compatibility issues with AGP 8.1.0+
- flutter_geofire, restart_app, and rounded_loading_button are incompatible with AGP 8.1.0+
- Always comment out functionality rather than removing it completely for easier restoration
- Update README.md to document compatibility changes and temporarily disabled features
